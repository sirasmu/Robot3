# Robot3

My first robot was an Arduino controlled robot that I designed an electrical circuit using transistors for current amplification. It had the very sexy name "Transport Robot".

My second robot was a LEGO NXT robot. It was programmed in Java. It wasn't that interesting in my opinion, but I feel like I did learn a lot. I named the robot "John Cena", because I wrote a method where the robot would play his theme "The Time is now". After this I had made a little program for fighting an opponent robot and to recognize whether it won.

Now it is time for making a new robot. This time it ought to be more challenging. I have a hard time getting started, since there is a lot to learn, if I don't want this to just be a repeat of my first robot. I planned to implement a little finite state machine for the robot at the first thing. Then the plan is to learn to use a Raspberry Pi and figure out a way to use it together with the robot.
